# Parse iPad multitouch logs into matrices usable by the infocapacity
# script. Requires R version >= 2.11.
#
# Load the file in R and call the parse_logs(). The result files are
# saved into a subdirectory which is by default called "data". The
# current directory is assumed to contain the log files (named
# <number>.log).
#
# The parse_logs function also optionally takes two parameters: logdir
# which is the directory containing the logs and destination which is the
# directory the results will be written to.
#
# Note that parsing ipad logs reliably is difficult in some cases due
# to the lack of identifiers on touch points (probably e.g. very fast
# movements). Therefore the results should be checked and if
# necessary, corrected by hand. (Also, bugs may and probably do remain
# in the code.)
#
# Also note that parsing for more than two simultaneous touch points is
# not implemented in the current version due to lack of test data. (Feel
# free to add this functionality if required.)
# 
# ======
# TL;DR:
# Usage: parse_logs() or
# parse_logs("ipad_logfile_directory", "result_directory")
# Check results before further use just in case.
# Does not work with data that has more than two simultaneous touch
# points. Support for more touch points should be implemented.
